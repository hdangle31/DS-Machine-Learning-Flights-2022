        <h2>5. Interpretations and Recommendations</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>5.1 Key Insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flight duration and air time are the strongest predictors of cancellations, suggesting that longer flights 
                    may be more prone to cancellation due to complex planning and increased exposure to changing conditions.</li>
                <li>Arrival and departure delays strongly correlate with cancellations, indicating that operational disruptions 
                    tend to cascade into cancellations.</li>
                <li>Weather factors, particularly humidity, pressure, and precipitation, significantly influence cancellation rates.</li>
                <li>Different airlines show varying cancellation rates, suggesting differences in operational robustness and policies.</li>
                <li>Seasonal patterns exist, with some months showing higher cancellation rates than others.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>5.2 Operational Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proactive Delay Management:</strong> Since delays correlate strongly with cancellations, implementing 
                more effective delay management strategies could help reduce cancellation rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather-Based Planning:</strong> Develop more sophisticated weather contingency plans, particularly 
                focusing on humidity, precipitation, and pressure changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Airline-Specific Strategies:</strong> Airlines with higher cancellation rates should analyze their 
                operations to identify specific areas for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Preparedness:</strong> Allocate additional resources during seasons with historically higher 
                cancellation rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Predictive Systems:</strong> Implement machine learning models (particularly Random Forest or 
                Gradient Boosting) for early cancellation prediction to improve passenger notification and resource reallocation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.3 Further Research Opportunities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop more detailed analysis of specific routes and airports to identify localized cancellation patterns.</li>
            <li>Investigate the relationship between aircraft type and cancellation probability.</li>
            <li>Explore the impact of staffing levels and crew scheduling on cancellation rates.</li>
            <li>Analyze the economic impact of different cancellation prediction and management strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Flight cancellations can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using machine learning models, with the most effective 
        models achieving significant predictive power. The analysis reveals that a combination of operational factors (flight duration, 
        delays) and environmental conditions (weather parameters) strongly influence cancellation probability.</p>
        
        <p>By implementing the recommendations provided in this report, airlines and airport operators can potentially reduce 
        cancellation rates, improve operational efficiency, and enhance passenger experience. The predictive models developed 
        in this analysis can serve as valuable tools for proactive flight management and resource allocation.</p>
