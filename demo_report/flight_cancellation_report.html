        <h1>Flight Cancellation Prediction Analysis</h1>
        <p>This report presents an analysis of flight cancellation prediction models using the flights2022 dataset. 
        The dataset contains information about flights in 2022, including various features related to flight schedules, 
        weather conditions, and cancellation status.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Dataset Overview</h2>
        <p>The analysis uses the flights2022_cleaned.csv dataset, which contains flight data with weather information 
        and other relevant features. The dataset has been cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and 
        create additional features that might be useful for prediction.</p>

        <h3>Dataset Statistics</h3>

        <h2>6. Interpretations and Recommendations</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>6.1 Key Insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flight duration and air time are the strongest predictors of cancellations, suggesting that longer flights 
                    may be more prone to cancellation due to complex planning and increased exposure to changing conditions.</li>
                <li>Arrival and departure delays strongly correlate with cancellations, indicating that operational disruptions 
                    tend to cascade into cancellations.</li>
                <li>Weather factors, particularly humidity, pressure, and precipitation, significantly influence cancellation rates.</li>
                <li>Different airlines show varying cancellation rates, suggesting differences in operational robustness and policies.</li>
                <li>Seasonal patterns exist, with some months showing higher cancellation rates than others.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>6.2 Operational Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proactive Delay Management:</strong> Since delays correlate strongly with cancellations, implementing 
                more effective delay management strategies could help reduce cancellation rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather-Based Planning:</strong> Develop more sophisticated weather contingency plans, particularly 
                focusing on humidity, precipitation, and pressure changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Airline-Specific Strategies:</strong> Airlines with higher cancellation rates should analyze their 
                operations to identify specific areas for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Preparedness:</strong> Allocate additional resources during seasons with historically higher 
                cancellation rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Predictive Systems:</strong> Implement machine learning models (particularly Random Forest or 
                Gradient Boosting) for early cancellation prediction to improve passenger notification and resource reallocation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>6.3 Further Research Opportunities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop more detailed analysis of specific routes and airports to identify localized cancellation patterns.</li>
            <li>Investigate the relationship between aircraft type and cancellation probability.</li>
            <li>Explore the impact of staffing levels and crew scheduling on cancellation rates.</li>
            <li>Analyze the economic impact of different cancellation prediction and management strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Flight cancellations can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using machine learning models, with the most effective 
                    models achieving significant predictive power. The analysis reveals that a combination of operational factor (distance)
                    and environmental conditions (weather parameters) strongly influence cancellation probability.</li>
                <li>The analysis reveals the challenge of predicting rare events like flight cancellations, which occur in only about 2% of flights in our dataset. 
                    While all models achieve high accuracy due to this class imbalance, the Random Forest model provides the best overall performance when considering the more meaningful F1-Score metric. 
                <li>The feature importance analysis confirms that weather-related factors (particularly pressure and visibility) along with flight distance are the most critical predictors, 
                    highlighting areas where airlines can focus their operational improvements to minimize cancellations. 
                <li>It's worth noting that even with the best model, the relatively low F1-Score (0.2509) indicates that predicting flight cancellations remains challenging, likely due to the complex and sometimes
                    unpredictable nature of factors contributing to cancellations.
                <li>Future work could explore ensemble approaches, additional feature engineering, or addressing the class imbalance through techniques like oversampling or undersampling.</li>
            </ul>
