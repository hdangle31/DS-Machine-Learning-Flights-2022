FLIGHT CANCELLATION PREDICTION ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
==========================================================

1. DATASET OVERVIEW
------------------

- Dataset contains 110,878 flight records from 2022
- Cancellation rate is 2.09%
- 40 features including flight details, weather conditions, and operational metrics
- Primary focus on flights from major Pacific Northwest airports (SEA, PDX)

2. ARRIVAL & DEPARTURE DELAY ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------
- Significant day-of-week patterns observed in both arrival and departure delays
- Delays show distinct temporal patterns throughout the day and across months
- Certain destinations consistently show higher average arrival delays
- Origin airports have varying departure delay profiles
- Monthly flight volume variations impact overall system performance
- Routes with highest duration differences indicate potential scheduling issues

3. KEY FINDINGS
--------------
- Most important predictors of cancellations: flight duration, air time, arrival/departure delays
- Weather factors significantly impact cancellations, particularly humidity, pressure, and precipitation
- Different airlines show varying cancellation rates, suggesting operational differences
- Seasonal patterns exist in cancellation rates
- Machine learning models (especially Random Forest) can predict cancellations with reasonable accuracy

4. MODEL PERFORMANCE
------------------
- Multiple models evaluated: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression
- Random Forest achieved the best F1-Score (0.2509), providing balanced performance
- Feature importance analysis confirms weather factors and flight distance as critical predictors
- Visual representations available in visualizations/model_comparison_all_metrics.png and visualizations/feature_importance.png

5. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Implement proactive delay management strategies to prevent cascading cancellations
- Develop more sophisticated weather contingency plans focused on humidity, precipitation, and pressure changes
- Address airline-specific operational issues for carriers with high cancellation rates
- Allocate additional resources during seasons with historically higher cancellation rates
- Deploy machine learning models (particularly Random Forest) for early cancellation prediction

6. NEXT STEPS
-----------
- Analyze specific routes and airports for localized patterns
- Investigate aircraft type impact on cancellations
- Explore staffing and crew scheduling effects
- Analyze economic impact of different cancellation management strategies
