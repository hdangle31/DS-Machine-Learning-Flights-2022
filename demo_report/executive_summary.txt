FLIGHT CANCELLATION PREDICTION ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
==========================================================

1. DATASET OVERVIEW
------------------

- Dataset contains 110,878 flight records from 2022
- Cancellation rate is 2.09%
- 40 features including flight details, weather conditions, and operational metrics

2. KEY FINDINGS
--------------
- Most important predictors of cancellations: flight duration, air time, arrival/departure delays
- Weather factors significantly impact cancellations, particularly humidity and pressure
- Different airlines show varying cancellation rates, suggesting operational differences
- Seasonal patterns exist in cancellation rates
- Machine learning models (especially tree-based models) can predict cancellations with good accuracy

3. MODEL PERFORMANCE
------------------
- Multiple models evaluated: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression
- Tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) generally performed best
- Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning improved model performance

4. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------
- Implement proactive delay management strategies
- Develop more sophisticated weather contingency plans
- Address airline-specific operational issues for carriers with high cancellation rates
- Allocate additional resources during seasons with higher cancellation rates
- Deploy machine learning models for early cancellation prediction

5. NEXT STEPS
-----------
- Analyze specific routes and airports for localized patterns
- Investigate aircraft type impact on cancellations
- Explore staffing and crew scheduling effects
- Analyze economic impact of different cancellation management strategies
